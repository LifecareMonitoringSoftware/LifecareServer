    <p># DISCLAIMERS</p>
    
    <p>THE LIFECARE SERVICE AND LIFECARE CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR THE LIFECARE SERVICE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no warranty that the Lifecare Service or Lifecare Content will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No warranty is provided that the product will be free from defects. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness, or reliability of the Lifecare Service or any Lifecare Content. Your use of the product and any material or services obtained or accessed via the product is at your own discretion and risk, and you are solely responsible for any damage resulting from their use. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you. </p>
    
    
    <p># INDEMNITY</p>
    
    <p>You will indemnify and hold harmless Lifecare or its officers, directors, employees, developers, contributors, affiliates, agents, licensors, and contractors from and against any claims, suits, actions, demands, disputes, allegations, or investigations brought by any third party, governmental authority, or industry body, and all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Lifecare Service, (ii) Your Content, (iii) your breach or alleged breach of any warranties made by you hereunder or your violation of any other provision of these Terms, or (iv) your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party. We reserve the right to assume control of the defense of any third-party claim that is subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>
    
    <p># LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
    
    <p>NEITHER LIFECARE, ITS SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS, NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE LIFECARE SERVICE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIFECARE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT LIFECARE HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
    
    <p>IN NO EVENT WILL LIFECARE'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIFECARE SERVICE EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO LIFECARE FOR USE OF THE LIFECARE SERVICE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO LIFECARE, AS APPLICABLE.</p>
    
    <p>THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN Lifecare AND YOU.</p>
    
    <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    
    <p># DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
    
    <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.</p>
    
    <p>You agree that any dispute between you and Lifecare arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service, the Lifecare Service, or any other Lifecare products or services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be governed by the arbitration procedure outlined below.</p>
    
    <p>Governing Law: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Terms of Service and the resolution of any Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws principles.</p>
    
    <p>Informal Dispute Resolution: We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Lifecare, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting us at our mailing address, and providing us with your email address. We'll try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting you through email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days after submission, you or Lifecare may bring a formal proceeding.</p>
    
    <p>We Both Agree To Arbitrate: You and Lifecare agree to resolve any Disputes through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</p>
    
    <p>Opt-out of Agreement to Arbitrate: You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting us in writing within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name) decline this arbitration agreement.</p>
    
    <p>Arbitration Procedures: The American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in San Diego, California, or any other location we agree to.</p>
    
    <p>Arbitration Fees: The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.</p>
    
    <p>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate: Either you or Lifecare may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Diego (CA) or any United States county where you live or work. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Lifecare products or Lifecare Service, or infringement of intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.</p>
    
    <p>No Class Actions: You may only resolve Disputes with Lifecare on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed under our agreement.</p>
    
    <p>Judicial Forum for Disputes: Except as otherwise required by applicable law, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and Lifecare agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of San Diego County, California. Both you and Lifecare consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.</p>
    
    <p>Limitation on Claims: Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Lifecare products or Lifecare Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be barred forever.</p>
    
    <p># GENERAL TERMS</p>
    
    <p>Except as otherwise stated herein, these Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Lifecare and you regarding the Lifecare Service, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Lifecare and you regarding the Lifecare Service and Lifecare Content.</p>
    
    <p>If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
    
    <p>You may not assign, delegate, or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Lifecare’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Lifecare may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p>
    
    <p>Any notices or other communications provided by Lifecare under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email or (ii) by posting to the Lifecare Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt on the message will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
    
    <p>Lifecare’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Lifecare. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
